1.UPC
  UPCs in our program are 4-digit integers. Each integer upc is uniquely associated with a product.

2. Location of products
  Each product's location consists of 2 integer--aisleNumber and shelveNumber.

3. The format of the initial inventory csv file should be:
   product upc, product name, product price, product quantity, product section, product threshold, product location

4. event.txt format
  GroceryDemo reads event.txt line by line, each line represents an event. An event has three
  components: performer, action, actionDetail. Those three are seperated using "/".
  I will list all possible event combination below.
  Words after ":" below are the exact strings that need to be put.
  Words inside "[]" are descriptions for the argument you need to put in event.txt

  performer: cashier
      action: scanProduct    actionDetail:[several upc, seperated using ",", for example 1,2,2,3]
      action: receivedCash   actionDetail: true

  performer: manager
      action: setSale  actionDetail:[(product upc), discount(number or number+"%", see setSale method
                              in Manager class for more information), (sale startDate), (sale endDate)[the format
                                of date should be yyyy-MM-DD]]
      action: checkInventory  actionDetail: true

  performer: receiver
      action: receiveProduct  actionDetail:  upc:quantity , upc:quantity  //can add more upc:quantity
      [Receiver can receive several products at the same time, the format for each product is
       upc : quantity ]

  performer: reshelver
      action: relocateProduct  actionDetail: upc, newAisleNumber:newShelveNumber
      [Reshelver can only relocate one type of product per time, the format is upc,
      newAisleNumber:newShelveNumber]

  performer: userquestion
      action: location  actiondetail:upc [User can ask the exact location of a product with its upc]
      action: quantity  actiondetail:upc [User can ask the exact quantity of a product with its upc]
      action: price     actiondetail:upc [User can ask the current price of a product with its upc ]

5.how to run our program
      this main method is contained in class GroceryDemo.
      when running GroceryDemo, DO make sure that the path of event.txt, inventory.csv are correct.
      because the path we are using for tesing is local path.
      event.txt and inventory.csv are both in ProjectPhase1!
